	* Pieter Berkel requested the ability to set field and document
	  boost values when adding documents to Solr: 
	  
	  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-341?focusedCommentId=12650095#action_12650095
	  
	  Added the ability to do so in the Apache_Solr_Document class and
	  updated the XML fragment generation code in Apache_Solr_Service to
	  include the new boost values when available.

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php: Rich Robinson raised an issue on the
	  Solr issue tracker where he found that documents with values =
	  false were creating prematurely exiting foreach loops. I tracked
	  it down to the valid() implementation of the Iterator iterface,
	  and after fussing with it decided to just implement
	  IteratorAggregator and use the pre-existing SPL ArrayIterator
	  class. Simplifies the code and now all document values are looped
	  even when some are false.

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php, Apache/Solr/Response.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service.php, Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: At the
	  request of several people using these classes I've changed the
	  members and functions that were private to protected so that they
	  can be overridden / used in subclasses

	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Changed default value for
	  $_backoffLimit to 10 minutes instead of 1 minute.

2008-08-26 13:52  dwolfe

	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php, Solr.clss: Added an increasing
	  backoff interval for SOLR write server selection. See core ticket
	  #274.

	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Looking at the load balanced
	  solr's on production it became obvious it was completely silly to
	  ping a solr service on selection. Instead, we select a read
	  service at random (if there are more than one) and use it until
	  there is a connection problem - then and ONLY then do we ping it
	  to decide if we should retry the call. If the ping timesout then
	  we select another read service (if one is available) and continue

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php: HTTP 100 Continue response can also be
	  returned before the REAL status header, so instead of just
	  looking at the first http header we should look through until the
	  last one.
	  
	  the spec for ref.:
	  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.1
	  
	  Thanks to Daniel Andersson for pointing out this oversight -
	  again, probably related to his build's used of libcurl for URL
	  wrappers

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: \r\n added to the end Content-Type
	  header was causing problems when compiled with the
	  --with-curlwrappers options. It had always seemed wrong to me,
	  but the documentation wasn't explicit as to whether it was added
	  directly to the headers or not.
	  
	  THANKS TO Daniel Andersson for finding this bug, since our php
	  build is not compiled with this options and we never would have
	  found it ourselves.

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php, ChangeLog: 5 seconds seemed like too
	  long a default timeout, set to 2. Added a Changelog that I'm
	  packaging with the distribution.

2008-01-14 19:12  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php, Solr.clss:
	  Using the json.nl parameter instead of mapping namedLists with my
	  own code. Added getters / setters for optional enhancements.

2007-10-19 16:42  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php: Added extra
	  options to Apache_Solr_Response to allow the turning off of
	  special "corrections" we do to the json response. In cases where
	  this isn't needed OR isn't desired it can be a small speed boost.
	  Changed the implementation of Apache_Solr_Service::search to use
	  http_build_query - had to combine it with a preg_replace, but
	  this is still significantly faster than doing all the urlencoding
	  ourselves in a loop written in PHP.

2007-10-17 15:14  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php, Apache/Solr/Response.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service.php, Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Added
	  ability to keep Response object from creating documents (can save
	  a little time when you don't need them). Also, updated the
	  balancer so that it will try other services during a
	  communication error on a call.

2007-10-02 02:52  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: Got rid of the const defined defaults
	  for host, port and path. Now defined within the constructor
	  signature so its easier to override in a subclass

2007-09-28 22:40  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php, Apache/Solr/Response.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service, Apache/Solr/Service.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php,
	  trunk/application/cit5_solr/start.inc: Add the
	  Apache_Solr_Service_Balancer ref. implementation for selecting
	  from multiple read or write solr instances (such as in a
	  replicated solr environment). Made the ping function of Service
	  more useful and faster. stopped ignoring when we couldn't talk to
	  a server (now throws a communication error exception). refs #29

2007-09-24 22:17  djimenez

	* Apache, Apache/Solr, Apache/Solr/Document.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php,
	  Solr/Document.php, Solr/Response.php, Solr/Service.php,
	  trunk/application/cit5_solr/start.inc: been suggested by
	  community to change class namespace to Apache_Solr... have kept
	  subclasses for backwards compatibility with code we have already
	  
	  need config constants for now
	  
	  closes #10, #16
